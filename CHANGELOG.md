### 0.1.2 (2019-03-23)

First (almost) stable release, which is basically the retrieved code from Robert2-client, just adapted to Typescript and TSX.

Please note that Vue-Plantt is NOT YET fully functionnal, some feature are missing, and there are still lots of bugs.

For now, it just:

- displays a daily (or hourly) grid between two dates
- displays events on the timeline
- avoids events collisions (only at startup, adding events afterward is buggy)
- can be view-controlled (start date, end date)

A lot of feature still need to be added (drag & drop, moving handles, component's event triggering...)
